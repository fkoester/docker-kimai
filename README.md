# docker-kimai

A docker image for Kimai time tracking based on the [official php docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/).

This repository also contains a `docker-compose.yaml` configuration file for simple usage together with the [official mariadb image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/).

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfile links

* `1.3.1`, `1.1.0`, `stable`, `latest` [(Dockerfile)](https://github.com/RalfHerzog/docker-kimai/blob/master/Dockerfile)

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have current versions of Docker (>= 1.12) and docker-compose (>= 1.9).
2. Clone this repository
3. Create a docker volume named `kimai-database`:

  ```bash
  $ docker volume create --name kimai-database
  ```

4. Create and start the docker containers using docker-compose:

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose up
  ```

  This will command will:

  * Fetch the necessary docker images
  * Start the Apache and Mariadb services
  * Setup persistent configuration in the autoconf.php and auth.php

After completion, you should be able to access the Kimai instance but with an error at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (this is caused by the empty autoconf.php file which will be filled during the setup).

5. To start the installation go to [http://localhost:8080/installer/index.php](http://localhost:8080/installer/index.php) and perform the initial installation. For the database connection choose the following parameters:

    * Host: *db*
    * User: *kimai*
    * Password: *kimai*
    * Database: *kimai* (Existing)

After you finished the installation, you should set the `KIMAI_REMOVE_INSTALLATION` environment variable to '1' (default is '0') in docker-compose.yaml:

```yaml
    environment:
      - KIMAI_REMOVE_INSTALLATION=1
```

This deletes the `installer/` directory on container start and prevents the warning after login.

## Configuration

If you want to use LDAP authentication, you have to set the `KIMAI_AUTHENTICATOR` variable to `ldap` or `ldapadvanced` as discribed in the [Kimai authentication documentation](http://www.kimai.org/documentation/administrator/authenticator.html). And set your additional configuration in the `auth.php` accordingly.
